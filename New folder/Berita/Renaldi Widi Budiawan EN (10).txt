WATCH: Titus takes a tumble during Greatest Royal Rumble entrance!
WWE's Royal Rumbles are well known for their shock entrances but Titus O'Neill took things to a unique level on Friday.

Arriving as number 39 in the 50-man Greatest Royal Rumble in Saudi Arabia on Friday night, O'Neill sprinted to the ring like a man on a mission to make an unforgettable impact on the landmark event.

He did, but not in the way he intended.The head of Titus Worldwide tripped as he reached the final stages of the sprint and fell into a headfirst dive which saw him slide under the ring and completely disappear.

The moment led to gales of laughter from both the commentators, the fans in the arena and doubtlessly the viewing audience at home.
