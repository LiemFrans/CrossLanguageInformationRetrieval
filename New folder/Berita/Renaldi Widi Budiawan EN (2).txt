Chelsea 3-1 Arsenal: Blues take control of FA Youth Cup final
Chelsea took control of the FA Youth Cup final after coming from behind to beat Arsenal 3-1 in the first leg at Stamford Bridge.

Xavier Amaechi gave the Gunners the lead in west London, scoring with a smart finish after being played through by Emile Smith-Rowe.

It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded in the competition but it did not deter the holders with substitute Daishawn Redan levelling the scores in the 66th minute.

Jody Morris' side turned the screw during the second-half and they eventually took the lead when Marc Guehi headed home Reece James cross.

And they extended their advantage as Redan added his second of the match, keeping the Blues on course to win a fifth consecutive FA Youth Cup ahead of the second leg at the Emirates Stadium on Monday.
