Information overload (also known as infobesity[1] or infoxication[2]) is a term used to describe the difficulty of understanding an issue and effectively making decisions when one has too much information about that issue.[3] The term is popularized by Alvin Toffler in his bestselling 1970 book Future Shock, but is mentioned in a 1964 book by Bertram Gross, The Managing of Organizations.[4] Speier et al. (1999) stated:[5]

Information overload occurs when the amount of input to a system exceeds its processing capacity. Decision makers have fairly limited cognitive processing capacity. Consequently, when information overload occurs, it is likely that a reduction in decision quality will occur.

In recent years, the term "information overload" has evolved into phrases such as information glut and data smog (Data Smog, Shenk, 1997). What was once a term grounded in cognitive psychology has evolved into a rich metaphor used outside the world of academia.

The advent of modern information technology has been a primary driver of information overload on multiple fronts: in quantity produced, ease of dissemination, and breadth of audience reached.[6] Longstanding technological factors have been further intensified by the rise of social media and the attention economy.

Clay Shirky, in a speech at the Web 2.0 Expo New York in 2008, has indicated that information overload in the modern age is a consequence of a deeper problem, which he calls filter failure.[7]
