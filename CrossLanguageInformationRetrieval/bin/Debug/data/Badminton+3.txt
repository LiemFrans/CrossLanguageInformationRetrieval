Tai Tzu Ying is like some ninja warrior, feels ace shuttler HS Prannoy--

Lucknow: In awe of women's shuttler Tai Tzu Ying, H S Prannoy has described the Taiwanese world no 1 as a "ninja warrior", whose strokes would be difficult to match even after practicing for a decade.

"Tai Tzu is one player who I think she like some ninja. She plays certain strokes for which you will have to probably practice for 10 years and still will not be able to get hold of them," said World No 10 Prannoy, who has so far notched up 10 consecutive wins in the Premier Badminton League.

"She has got unbelievable feel in her hands and is one girl who enjoys the most when she plays badminton that is what makes her a special candidate. I am glad I am with her in the team and I'm able to play against her in the practice session," he added.

With five super series titles, Tai Tzu has been in stellar form this season and is currently unbeaten with three wins on the trot in the PBL with her last victory coming against India's Saina Nehwal who plays for Awadhe Warriors.

Prannoy feels there is always something to learn from Tai Tzu, whether she is on the court or off it.

"She is always happy with whatever she is doing but and I think that is a very important thing. You need to be happy with what you have and you need not probably spend your time thinking I am not getting this or that," he said.

"I have learnt so much from Tai Tzu and I really glad that I am sharing the dressing room with her," the 2017 Indian National champion said.

Talking about his own stellar form in the PBL, he said, "It is very important I could keep on contributing to the success of my team. It is quite essential that I kind of repay the faith that my team has instilled in me and I am happy to be able to deliver on the expected line.

"And I guess I happy with the fact that I am now on 10 match unbeaten streak in PBL and it is always good to be in the doubles digits than single.
