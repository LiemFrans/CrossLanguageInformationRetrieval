iPhone 9 to possibly skip 3D Touch: Report

The iPhone 6s debuted one of the most revolutionary technologies that became key to an iPhone’s appeal — 3D Touch. 3D Touch paved way for the rival Android platform to develop long-press contextual menus on home screen icons. However, insider information suggests that Apple could ditch 3D Touch for one of its mainstream iPhone models, along with its rumoured budget iPhone SE 2, for this year’s lineup.

Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the most prominent names in the world of iPhone leaks, suggests that Apple won’t be considering the inclusion of 3D Touch for the more affordable mainstream iPhone model of 2018 — the rumoured 6.1-inch iPhone with an LCD display. Apple is probably going for a new ‘Cover Glass Sensor’ (CGS) display technology that will help them strengthen the glass against shocks and will lighten the overall weight. However, in doing that, Apple will be looking at an increased cost per panel, which could result in hiked prices for the end consumer.

Since the whole point of this LCD iPhone is to keep it affordable to battle the likes of the upcoming OnePlus 6 and other similarly priced Android smartphones, Apple will omit 3D Touch in this model, which will likely keep the costs in check while adopting the newer technology. Now, this could be an issue for those used to the 3D Touch on premium iPhones, which is also responsible for defining the qualities of the iPhone’s user experience. However, the 2016 iPhone SE did well without the 3D Touch by using an Android-esque long-press gesture.

This is still a rumour, which means that this information might not make into a reality anytime soon. However, since it comes from Kuo, one can hope that Apple could be doing something similar. Remember Kuo’s prediction for the iPhone X’s FaceID last year, which turned out to be true?
