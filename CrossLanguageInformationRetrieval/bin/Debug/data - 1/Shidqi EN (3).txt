If you remember anything about Trans World Airlines (better known as TWA), you probably remember the legendary white TWA Flight Center just outside of John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.
Designed in 1962 by groundbreaking Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, the former flight center has been redesigned and reimagined into the TWA hotel, set to open in the spring of 2019.

While the hotel opening has been on the radar for a while, a model room of this 1960s-inspired hotel has finally been revealed.
This is good news for architecture buffs, since there had been rumors that the long-empty terminal was going to be razed, and for aviation fans who miss the much-loved airline, which shut down in 2001.

"Trendy" and "near the airport" are no longer mutually exclusive, as this will be the first hotel on JFK's grounds -- no taxi required.
The hotel is set in two low-rise buildings and will have 512 guest rooms, featuring Knoll furnishings and old Hollywood-inspired interiors. The hotel will also offer 50,000 square feet of conference, event and meeting space.

"From the moment guests and visitors arrive at the TWA hotel, they will find themselves immersed in the ethos of 1962's rich culture, architecture, sights, sounds and ambiance," explains Tyler Morse, CEO of MCR and MORSE Development, the developer and lead investor of this buzz-worthy project.
"The attention to the smallest of details permeates the entire guest room experience, paying homage to the magnificent landmark and special time in American history."

It also doesn't hurt that mid-century design is having (another) moment thanks to shows like "Mad Men." Still, don't expect the hotel to feel too much like a period piece: There will be plenty of places to charge your phone, and smoking won't be permitted.
Besides the rooms themselves, there will be eight restaurants and six bars -- and, yes, you can get a martini.
If you just can't hold out until next year, sate your urges by visiting the TWA Lounge at the One World Trade skyscraper in Manhattan.
